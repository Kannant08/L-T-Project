# L-T-Project
Alcohol Detection Project

AIM: To develop a robust alcohol detection system to combat the critical issue of drunk driving, which poses a significant risk to road safety.
The system should effectively and non-invasively detect alcohol impairment in drivers and alert law enforcement or the driver to prevent accidents and potential fatalities, 
thereby reducing the incidence of alcohol-related accidents on the road.

Solution/Resuts: The solution will involve integrating alcohol detection sensors into vehicles or at checkpoints to capture the presence of alcohol in a driver's breath, sweat, 
or other relevant bodily fluids.
The system will trigger alerts when it detects alcohol impairment in a driver. 
Alerts can be sent to law enforcement authorities, a centralized monitoring center, or the driver themselves through alarms, notifications, or other communication means.
